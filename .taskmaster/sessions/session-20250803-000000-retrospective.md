# Session Retrospective - 2025-08-03

## Session Summary

- **Duration**: ~2 hours
- **Tasks Worked On**: Fixing deployment blocking issues in etsy-manager codebase
- **Tasks Completed**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors, Next.js build errors
- **Tasks In Progress**: None
- **Primary Achievement**: Resolved 11 major categories of deployment blockers

## Critical Issues Discovered

### 1. Missing Prisma Models (OAuthSession, EtsyToken)
- **Impact**: High - Code referenced models that didn't exist in schema
- **Root Cause**: Schema evolution without corresponding code updates
- **Detection**: Only caught during TypeScript compilation

### 2. Dependency Version Mismatches
- **Impact**: High - Redis client type incompatibility (ioredis 5.4.1 vs 5.6.1)
- **Root Cause**: Dependencies updated without checking type compatibility
- **Detection**: TypeScript compilation errors

### 3. Next.js 14 Breaking Changes
- **Impact**: Medium - useSearchParams requires Suspense boundaries
- **Root Cause**: Framework upgrade without updating components
- **Detection**: Runtime errors during static generation

### 4. Accumulated Technical Debt
- **Impact**: Medium - Unused imports, variables, missing null checks
- **Root Cause**: No continuous linting/type checking during development
- **Detection**: TypeScript strict mode compilation

## Difficulties Encountered

### Tool Usage Issues

- [x] Incorrect tool selection (should have run build earlier)
- [ ] Inefficient command sequences
- [ ] Missing tool capabilities
- Examples: 
  - Spent time running autonomous tests before basic build verification
  - Should have started with `pnpm build` immediately

### Code/Architecture Challenges

- [x] Misunderstood patterns or conventions
- [ ] Performance bottlenecks identified
- [ ] Security concerns discovered
- Examples:
  - Assumed test models (OAuthSession, EtsyToken) existed when they didn't
  - Didn't realize User model had the token fields

### Process Inefficiencies

- [x] Repeated similar actions unnecessarily
- [ ] Failed to use batch operations
- [x] Missed automation opportunities
- Examples:
  - Fixed errors one by one instead of analyzing patterns
  - Could have used grep to find all OAuthSession references at once

## Mistakes & Learnings

1. **Mistake**: Not running build verification first
   **Learning**: Always start debugging with `pnpm build` for deployment issues
   **Action**: Add to session start protocol: "For deployment issues, run build first"

2. **Mistake**: Assuming Prisma models existed based on code references
   **Learning**: Always verify schema matches code assumptions
   **Action**: Check `prisma.schema` before making model-based fixes

3. **Mistake**: Not checking for framework-specific breaking changes
   **Learning**: Next.js 14 has specific requirements (Suspense for client hooks)
   **Action**: Review framework migration guides when seeing version mismatches

4. **Mistake**: Creating test files without running them
   **Learning**: Test files accumulated with wrong dependencies and bad references
   **Action**: Always run tests immediately after creating them

## Performance Improvements for Next Session

### High Priority

- [x] Run `pnpm build` immediately for any deployment-related issues
- [x] Check Prisma schema before assuming models exist
- [x] Use grep/search for all occurrences of problematic patterns
- [x] Verify test dependencies are installed before creating tests

### Medium Priority

- [x] Set up pre-commit hooks for TypeScript and linting
- [x] Run build after major code changes
- [x] Keep dependencies in sync across monorepo
- [x] Document breaking changes when upgrading frameworks

### Tool-Specific Optimizations

- **Preferred Tools**: 
  - `Grep` for finding all occurrences of a pattern (e.g., "OAuthSession")
  - `MultiEdit` for fixing multiple instances in same file
  - Build commands before test commands
- **Avoid**: 
  - Running complex test suites before basic build passes
  - Assuming code patterns without checking schema/types
- **New Patterns**: 
  - Always check schema.prisma for model existence
  - Run typecheck frequently during development

## Knowledge Gaps Identified

- [x] Next.js 14 client component requirements (Suspense boundaries)
- [x] Prisma schema evolution best practices
- [x] Monorepo dependency management
- [x] TypeScript strict mode implications

## Session Metrics

- Commands executed: ~50
- Files modified: 15
- Tests run: 0 (build failed before tests)
- Build time impact: Reduced from failing to passing

## Recommendations for Next Session

1. **Start with**: Build verification (`pnpm build`)
2. **Prioritize**: Setting up git hooks for continuous validation
3. **Research**: Next.js 14 migration guide for other potential issues
4. **Verify**: All test files have proper dependencies

## Proposed Session Protocol Improvements

### Pre-Development Checks
```bash
# Add to session start protocol
echo "=== Pre-Development Health Check ==="
pnpm typecheck || echo "⚠️ TypeScript errors present"
pnpm build || echo "⚠️ Build failing"
pnpm test || echo "⚠️ Tests failing"

# Quick schema verification
echo "=== Prisma Schema Models ==="
grep "^model" prisma/schema.prisma | awk '{print $2}'
```

### Continuous Validation During Development
```bash
# Run after every 3-5 file edits
pnpm typecheck --incremental

# Run before marking any task complete
pnpm build
```

### Model Reference Verification
```bash
# Before using any Prisma model in code
grep -n "model ModelName" prisma/schema.prisma || echo "❌ Model doesn't exist!"
```

### Dependency Sync Check
```bash
# Check for version mismatches in monorepo
pnpm ls --recursive --depth 0 | grep -E "(ioredis|next|react)" | sort | uniq -c
```

## Critical Insights

1. **Schema-Code Drift**: The biggest issue was code referencing non-existent database models. This suggests schema changes were made without updating dependent code.

2. **No Continuous Integration**: These errors would have been caught immediately with CI/CD running on every commit.

3. **Test Debt**: Test files were created but never run, accumulating errors over time.

4. **Framework Migration Incomplete**: Next.js 14 upgrade was done without addressing all breaking changes.

## Action Items for Codebase

1. **Immediate**:
   - [ ] Set up husky pre-commit hooks for typecheck
   - [ ] Add GitHub Actions for continuous build verification
   - [ ] Document the actual database schema

2. **Short-term**:
   - [ ] Audit all test files and fix or remove broken ones
   - [ ] Complete Next.js 14 migration checklist
   - [ ] Add schema-code consistency checks

3. **Long-term**:
   - [ ] Implement database migration testing
   - [ ] Set up dependency update automation with tests
   - [ ] Create development environment validation script

## Success Metrics for Improvement

- Zero TypeScript errors on every commit
- Build passes on every PR
- Test suite runs successfully daily
- No schema-code mismatches
- Dependencies stay in sync across monorepo

*This retrospective identifies systemic issues in the development process that allowed deployment-blocking errors to accumulate. The key lesson: continuous validation throughout development prevents surprise failures at deployment time.*
