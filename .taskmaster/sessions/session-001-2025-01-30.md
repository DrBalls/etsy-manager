# Session Retrospective - 001 (2025-01-30)

## Session Summary

- **Duration**: ~20 minutes
- **Tasks Worked On**: Task 1 - Setup Project Repository and Development Environment
- **Tasks Completed**: Subtasks 1.1 and 1.2
- **Tasks In Progress**: Task 1 (parent task)

## Difficulties Encountered

### Tool Usage Issues

- [x] Incorrect tool selection (used multiple LS/Glob when Task agent would be better)
- [x] Inefficient command sequences
- [ ] Missing tool capabilities
- Examples:
  - Used npx create-turbo with interactive prompts instead of manual setup
  - Had to retry pnpm installation after create-turbo failed

### Code/Architecture Challenges

- [ ] Misunderstood patterns or conventions
- [ ] Performance bottlenecks identified
- [ ] Security concerns discovered
- Examples: None in this session

### Process Inefficiencies

- [x] Repeated similar actions unnecessarily
- [ ] Failed to use batch operations
- [ ] Missed automation opportunities
- Examples:
  - Multiple build attempts due to TypeScript configuration issues
  - Could have created all type files in a single MultiEdit operation

## Mistakes & Learnings

1. **Mistake**: Tried to use create-turbo CLI which prompted for interactive input
   **Learning**: Manual setup is more controllable for automated workflows
   **Action**: Create configuration files manually when working with Turborepo

2. **Mistake**: TypeScript build errors due to incremental compilation and imports
   **Learning**: Shared packages need careful TypeScript configuration
   **Action**: Remove incremental compilation for library builds, ensure all imports are explicit

3. **Mistake**: Changed directory context but some commands assumed root directory
   **Learning**: Always use absolute paths or verify current working directory
   **Action**: Use `pwd` to verify location before running context-dependent commands

## Performance Improvements for Next Session

### High Priority

- [ ] Create all related files with MultiEdit when possible
- [ ] Test TypeScript configuration before attempting builds
- [ ] Use Task agent for exploring existing monorepo examples

### Medium Priority

- [ ] Consider using a monorepo template or starter
- [ ] Pre-validate all package.json dependencies before install

### Tool-Specific Optimizations

- **Preferred Tools**: MultiEdit for multiple file creation, Task for research
- **Avoid**: Interactive CLI tools that require user input
- **New Patterns**: Manual Turborepo setup is more reliable than CLI

## Knowledge Gaps Identified

- [ ] Turborepo best practices for TypeScript monorepos
- [ ] Optimal tsup configuration for shared packages
- [ ] pnpm workspace configuration details

## Session Metrics

- Commands executed: ~25
- Files created: 30+ (types, utils, configs)
- Tests run: 0 (no tests implemented yet)
- Build attempts: 5 (succeeded on 5th attempt)

## Recommendations for Next Session

1. **Start with**: Continue with subtask 1.3 - Bootstrap Application Packages
2. **Prioritize**: Create app scaffolding for extension, web, desktop, and API
3. **Research**: Best practices for Plasmo/WXT browser extension setup
4. **Verify**: Shared package can be imported correctly before proceeding
