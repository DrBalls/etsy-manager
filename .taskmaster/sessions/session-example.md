# Session Retrospective - Example (2025-01-30)

## Session Summary

- **Duration**: ~30 minutes
- **Tasks Worked On**: Initial project setup and CLAUDE.md creation
- **Tasks Completed**: CLAUDE.md creation with self-improving protocol
- **Tasks In Progress**: None (initial setup phase)

## Difficulties Encountered

### Tool Usage Issues

- [ ] Incorrect tool selection (used X when should have used Y)
- [x] Inefficient command sequences
- [ ] Missing tool capabilities
- Examples: Used Read tool with limit parameter when full file was needed

### Code/Architecture Challenges

- [ ] Misunderstood patterns or conventions
- [ ] Performance bottlenecks identified
- [ ] Security concerns discovered
- Examples: None in this session

### Process Inefficiencies

- [x] Repeated similar actions unnecessarily
- [ ] Failed to use batch operations
- [ ] Missed automation opportunities
- Examples: Could have used Task agent to explore project structure more efficiently

## Mistakes & Learnings

1. **Mistake**: Initially tried to set todo status to "done" instead of "completed"
   **Learning**: TodoWrite tool uses "completed" not "done" for finished tasks
   **Action**: Remember correct status values: pending, in_progress, completed

2. **Mistake**: Read only first 100 lines of tasks.json when needed full context
   **Learning**: Avoid using limit parameter unless file is known to be very large
   **Action**: Default to reading full files, only limit when necessary

## Performance Improvements for Next Session

### High Priority

- [ ] Use Task agent for comprehensive file exploration instead of multiple LS/Glob calls
- [ ] Batch related tool calls when possible for efficiency

### Medium Priority

- [ ] Review previous retrospectives before starting work
- [ ] Use task-master research for unfamiliar libraries/patterns

### Tool-Specific Optimizations

- **Preferred Tools**: Task agent for exploration, MultiEdit for multiple changes
- **Avoid**: Sequential Edit calls when MultiEdit would work
- **New Patterns**: Self-improving session protocol with retrospectives

## Knowledge Gaps Identified

- [ ] Etsy API v3 specific implementation details
- [ ] Plasmo/WXT framework for browser extensions
- [ ] TimescaleDB for time-series analytics

## Session Metrics

- Commands executed: ~15
- Files modified: 2 (CLAUDE.md, session-example.md)
- Tests run: 0 (setup phase)
- Build time impact: N/A

## Recommendations for Next Session

1. **Start with**: Review this retrospective and check task-master list
2. **Prioritize**: Task 1 - Setup monorepo structure
3. **Research**: Turborepo vs Nx comparison for monorepo
4. **Verify**: All development dependencies are available
